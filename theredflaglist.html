	<h2>The Red Flag List</h2>
		<div class="red flag list">
			<h3>Says Slurs</h3>
			<p>A slur is an offensive term used to show a lack of respect for a particular group of people. Intentional use of a slur can be classified as hate speech and contributes to the oppression of the related minoritized group. <br> </br>
				Even if the slur is used against people outside of the affected group or as a "joke", it still has harm by reinforcing harmful opressive norms. This ignorance is simply not acceptable in this era and it is most definitely not funny. It's honestly so embarassing that someone feels the need to use slurs in order to be funny :/<br> </br>

			<h3>Doesn't try to get to know your friends or talks shit about them</h3>
			<p>Friends are part of your support system, and it's normal for a long term partner to get to know, or even join your friend group. Similar to not taking an interest in your interests, intentionally not getting to know your friends is reflective of wanting you to integrate into their life, but putting no effort in doing the same for you. <br></br>
				Talking shit about your friends is a tool that is sometimes used as a way to isolate you from your support system. By alienating you from people who would likely call your partner out on their bs, your partner is trying to make it as hard as possible for you to leave them. Isolation is often seen as a warning sign of potenital future or current abuse. If you or someone you know is in an abusive situation, please refer to our <a href="rfp.resources.html">Resource Page</a> for help.

			<h3>Whines, guilt-trips, or mopes around when you don't have sex with them</h3>
			<p>Whining and moping around when you simply say "no" is a form of manipulation with the goal of coercing you into sex. While your partner may not see it this way, this action is ignoring your consent and bodily autonomy. Consent is a sober & enthusiastic yes, and having to convince you to have sex with them is not enthusiastic! It's always been weird to me that people want to have sex with people who aren't in the mood at all ... like how is that fun ? 
			<br></br>
				This <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8RH1uGu/">tiktok</a> explains this concept really well. And <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8RHNh7S/">this</a> one! This <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8RHejGW/">tiktok</a> explains a common experience of straight women and it sucks so much !
				<!-- insert link!! --></p>

			<h3>Pressures you to have sex without protection</h3>
			<p>This is another form of your partner ignoring your consent and bodily autonomy. Forcing you to not use protection is a form of sexual assualt. Any form of coercion (ie threatening to break up with you unless you have unprotected sex, etc.) is also considered sexual assault.
			<br></br>

			<h3>Addicted to drugs or alcohol</h3>
			<p>Addiction can often be unnoticed, especially in college. Things like drinking almost every night or needing weed to sleep or eat are often normalized among young adults, but these habits are reflective of a dependance on a substance in order to function. While addiction is a disease and deserves to be treated with compassion, dating someone with an addiction that they refuse to aknowledge can be mentally taxing. It's very difficult to have an equal partnership with someone who has a serious drug or alcohol dependency. <br></br>

			</p>

			<h3>Mentally ill AND has terrible coping mechanisms</h3>
			<p>Mentall illness is an incredibly difficult thing to navigate, but it is important to remember that is is not your job to regulate and manage someone else's emotions or mental illness. You are also not responsible for being someone's sole support system. Your partner putting all of that on you is an example of unhealthy coping. If your partner is struggling with this, encourage them to expand their support system and find other methods for regulating their emotions (see link for more info on this). While it is normal to want to support your partner through difficult times, this should not be at the expense of your own mental wellbeing. 
				<br></br>
			If someone is using their mentall illness as an excuse for harming you or others, RUN!! Mentall illness is an explanation for behavior, not an excuse and it is important for individuals struggling with mental illness to take accountability for their actions and apologize without using their diagnosis as way to avoid fault.

			<h3>A-Political/Doesn't care if you have rights or not :/</h3>
			<p>I can already hear the uproar. Cry about it :/ I am steadfast in the idea that ignoring the current political state in the US is an extreme priviledge. Not only is it a priviledge, it is also disregarding the people who are actively losing their rights as every day passes (women, members of the LGBTQ+, BIPOC, etc.). I don't think this one needs elaboration tbh.</p>

			<h3>Past Cheater</h3>
			<p>I'll admit that the implications of being a past cheater can change greatly based on context. However, at best, it was a "mistake" that greatly hurt someone they cared about. At worst, it was a malicious and selfish action that invovled lying to their partner(s). Neither are qualities that I particularly want in a partner

			<h3>Tells you that "you're making too big of a deal about this" or that you're crazy for something that is valid</h3>
			<p>This is an example of gaslighting. Gaslighting is a harmful manipulation tactic used to get someone to question their sanity or reasoning. Gaslighting is often used to take something that is their fault (like cheating, "I never did that, you're crazy") and turn it on you ("why dont you trust me?!"). 
				<br></br>
					You can read more about gaslighting <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201704/7-stages-gaslighting-in-relationship">here</a>. Gaslighting is often seen in abusive relationships or can be a warning sign for abuse; see our <a href="rfp.resources.html">Resources page</a> for more information.

			<h3>Multiple of your friends hate your partner</h3>
			<p>Oftentimes, people in relationships can ignore the red flags because they have rose colored glasses on. However, you friends do not have those glasses. They can see the impact that your partner has on your happiness and wellbeing, and if it's not positive, a good friend will let you know! They're not crazy or jealous or whatever else your partner might say about them, they see through your partner's bs and are trying to protect you!
			<br></br>

			<h3>You've caught them in a lie multiple times</h3>
			<p>Honesty is part of the foundation of any healthy relationship (not the brutal "I'm just being honest why are you offended" honesty - that's a red flag, but just not lying). Honesty means telling your partner when something is bothering you, and them doing the same. It means not lying about where they are or what they've been doing. It also means admitting when you might've fucked up, taking accountability, and doing what you can to earn forgiveness.
			<br></br>

			<h3>They take no interest in the things you're interested in.</h3>
			<p>Tbh I see this one most often in heterosexual relationships. While it can happen in any relationship. I often see men having the expectation of their partner integrating seamlessly into their lives (they don't want to be inconvenienced at all), but they often do not return the favor. I love hearing people talk about things they're passionate about or teaching me about their hobbies, and want the same thing in return from a partner. Your partner doesn't have to love everything that you love, but they should actively listen and take interest when you talk about it.</p>

			<h3>You don't want to be more like them</h3>
			<p>The best relationships are the ones where both or all partners are making eachother better people. A relationship where you don't grow positively at all seems like a waste. Why commit your life to this person if they're not making you better in some shape or form? Also, if you look at someone and don't see anything you want to be more of, then you're basically training this person to get on your level - all of the emotional labor is on your side.</p>

			<h3>Punches holes in walls</h3>
			<p>The scariest example of punching walls is when someone is fighting with their partner. When they punch a wall out of anger, they are showing you what they are capable of doing to you. It is an active threat and reflective of possible physical abuse in the future. Alternatively, punching walls when their sport team loses or when they're generally frusterated shows a general lack of maturity. They need to learn how to feel things other than anger before they get into a relationship.
			<br></br>
			Punching holes can be a warning sign of abuse. See our <a href="rfp.resources.html">Resources page</a> for more information and support.</p>

			<h3>They're super messy / never clean shared spaces / their roommate(s) don't like them</h3>
			<p>Serious relationship often progress to living together and it is important to take note of their behaviors in a household. Women notoriously do disproportionally more unpaid household labor and that can be exhausting and lead to growing resentment over time. Knowing how to clean is a basic adult skill that all people should have! Unless you want to be the only one cleaning for eternity, this is definitely a red flag. 
			<br></br>

				<!-- insert link!! look at fair play !!--></p>

			<h3>Rude to waiters or don't tip well</h3>
			<p>Being rude to service staff or not tipping well is often reflective of classism. Classism is the belief that someone's economic status makes them more valuable or worthy in society. Class mobility is getting increasingly harder in the United States and the "pulling yourself up by the bootstraps" mentality is super outdated and unrealistic at this point. Also ... service workers are literally the backbone of our society and it's so wack to disparage a service that they rely on to make their life easier!</p>

			<h3>Insufferable Boring</h3>
			<p>Idk how to even explain this one. I feel like y'all get it.</p>
			<h3>Doesn't trust you or accuses you of cheating for no reason</h3>
			<p>This behavior is often seen when someone is projecting. Projecting is when someone thinks someone is doing or feeling something because that is how they act or feel. This behavior can also see when someone has unresolved issues from a past relationship. If they can't trust you simply because they've been cheated on in the past, maybe they should unpack that before baselessly accusing their new partner

			<h3>Makes you cry more than two times a month</h3>
			<p>It is not normal to constantly be fighting with your partner !! It is not normal for your partner to upset you to the point of tears often !! A healthy relationship will have it's fair share of problems, but those problems should be resolved peacefully and respectfully. These problems should also be relatively far and few between.

			<h3>Can't or unwilling to make you cum</h3>
			<p>With the exclusion of people who are asexual or people who are chosing to abstain (which is a choice that should be respected), sexual intimacy is an important aspect of many relationships. It is not promising if you partner is unwilling to try to give you sexual pleasure. I have met SO many women in heterosexual relationships who have literally not orgasmed a single time with their partner. Girl !! get a vibrator !!

			<h3>They refuse to put any effort into your relationship</h3>
			<p>Relationships are a two way street! You should not be the only one planning dates, doing nice things for your partner, or scheduling time to hang out. Examples of this include: only wanting to hang out after 9pm, only wanting to hang out at home and do nothing, never planning dates, forcing you to plan your own birthday/anniversary/etc.</p>

			<h3>"I'm socially liberal, but fiscally conservative"</h3>
			<p> Ugh just shut up no one cares ! Trickle down economics doesn't work and prioritizing their tax breaks over other people's well being is wack :/</p>

			<h3>No ambition, no plans for their future</h3>
			<p>It is understandable to not 100% know what you want to do with their life, but they should at least know if you are in that picture. This red flag is especially relevant for people who are driven, passionate, and in long term relationships. It will only get more and more frusterating to see your partner put no effort into their life.</p>

			<h3>Their friend group has bad vibes</h3>
			<p>People are who they hang out with! If their friends are mean, have terrible habits, rapists, etc., you should maybe question how and why your partner justifies their behavior.</p>

			<h3>Terrible taste in food / has vastly different taste in food than you</h3>
			<p>People definitely have valid justifications for being picky eaters (sensory issues, safe foods, etc.) - this red flag is not referring to that. This red flag was added because me and my best friend /love/ food - we love trying new food, sharing food that we cook, and eating family style at restaurants so we can try everything! And it would definitely be a downer to be dating someone who wouldn't participate in any of that with me. This red flag is more of a compatability issue than something that can be "fixed."</p>

			<h3>They try to tell you what to wear</h3>
			<p>This behavior stems from insecurity and a need to control you. Neither are good qualities in a partner. They should trust that what you wear has no ulterior motive. Clothes are often a reflection of who someone is and how they want to be perceived, and your partner shouldn't want to stifle this form of self expression!
				<br></br>
				Controlling behavior can be a warning sign for abuse. See our <a href="rfp.resources.html">Resource page</a> for more information.</p>

			<h3>Not an active listener</h3>
			<p>If you see your partner's eyes glazing over as you're speaking or if they start checking their phone and just say "yea" every couple of seconds - Bad! This is especially worse if you've expressed that this is something that bothers you. I don't think I need to explain this one further.</p>

			<h3>They let you know that you're replacable / wants a gold star for not cheating</h3>
			<p>No one deserves an award for not cheating. And telling you about people that have flirted with them and they have refused is a way of telling you that they have other options and that you are blessed to even be in their presence. They're trying to manipulate you into accepting the bare minimum and you deserve way more than that!</p>

			<h3>They're one of those gym people that won't season their food because they don't want the extra calories</h3>
			<p>This situation is a little niche, but is more broadly referencing people who are obsessive with their food. This can sometimes be reflective of an eating disorder or disordered eating behaviors and can be very triggering for someone in recovery from an ED. See the link below to learn more about dating someone with an eating disorder.

			<h3>Calls their mom "Mommy"</h3>
			<p>no notes</p>

			<h3>Commitment issues</h3>
			<p>If your partner freaks out everytime the relationship moves forward, they definitely have some anxious attachment or commitment issues. It is not your job to convince your partner to be with you! If someone tells you that they're not ready for a relationship, believe them and save yourself the heartache later!</p>

			<h3>White and complains about not getting into a school because of affirmative action</h3>
			<p>Well this one will slowly get less relevant now that affirmative action is gone (rip). This behavior is reflective of ego and a refusal to accept that they simply weren't good enough. This also means that they have a hard time comprehending that women or minoritized groups could possibly be smarter than them - that's sexism and racism bestie - run !</p>

			<h3>Always makes self-depricating comments or has no self-confidence</h3>
			<p>This behavior is so high school. Self-depricating jokes aren't funny and they just make me feel bad for you. People who don't have self confidence are going to have a harder time believing that someone could be interested in them and they will use this to manipulate and make you feel bad for them in order to prevent you from ever breaking up with them. They also will put you on a pedestal and it will not look pretty when that fake facade cracks.</p>

			<h3>Pretentious</h3>
			<p>As a Georgia Tech grad, I saw this one A Lot. I get it! They've read Catcher in the Rye, exclusively watch A24 movies, and will only listen to artists with under 50,000 listeners on spotify, but have they ever considered talking about literally /anything/ else and actually having a real personality that's not entirely centered around making themselves feel better than everyone else? Anytime someone is pretentious to me I tell them that I think the Twilight franchise is a cinematic masterpiece and my favorite film - it's really fun, I highly recommend it.</p>

			<h3>Reagan Bush '84 shirt</h3>
			<p>Ronald Reagan sucked. That's all.</p>

			<h3>No emotional intelligence, responds to conflict like a child</h3>
			<p>Examples of this: bringing up something you did wrong when you're trying to talk about something they did that hurt you (this is deflection; they're avoiding accountability), giving you the silent treatment (are they 12 what is this?), or they're mean/snippy to you when dealing with personal problems (taking their emotions out on you is not okay and shows a lack of emotional regulation and coping skills). It's not your job to teach your partner what to do in these scenarios either. These are skills that should be developed outside of a relationship.

			<h3>Told you they loved in the first two weeks</h3>
			<p>This behavior can be the start of something called love bombing. Love bombing is when someone showers you with love and affection in the beginning of a relationship, only for that love to be withdrawn and used as a manipulation tactic once you're "hooked"
			<br></br>

			<h3>Never gives you compliments</h3>
			<p>This one is obvious once you read it, but you might not notice what you're missing in the relationship. You're partner should be your personal hype person! Verbal validation is an important aspect of a relationship!</p>

			<h3>Constantly plays the victim or can't take accountability</h3>
			<p>If you have an argument with your partner over something they did, and YOU end up being the one to apologize at the end of it ... something's not right. They are likely finding some way to flip the script to deflect and avoid accountability. This is reflective of a lack of maturity.
			<br></br>

			<h3>Finance bro (of any gender)</h3>
			<p>Listen, I respect the hustle, get that bag or whatever. But I draw the line at having to listen to someone talk about how cryptocurrency is the next frontier of the financial market and how artificially inflating the stock price of GameStop was actually "really bad". It's giving ... class traitor. Plus being a capitalist king/queen/royal is a little alarming ya know ... like at least aknowledge the problems with the system. Before you get your panties in a twist, this one barely counts for anything for the list.</p>

			<h3>Negatively comments on your appearance</h3>
			<p>This one has no excuse. There's no reason to put anyone down over something they can't control, much less their partner. This one is so icky. Constantly insulting you is often seen as a manipulation tactic designed to lower your self-confidence to make you feel like you can't do any better. 
				<br></br>

			<h3>Doesn't listen to any artists that are women</h3>
			<p>It's giving ~misogyny~. This one is especially bad if they're very vocal about hating "mainstream" artists that are women like Taylor Swift, Lizzo, etc. The least you can do is respect them as artists!</p>

			<h3>Wears flip flops in a non-aquatic setting</h3>
			<p>This is only referring to thong flip flops, other sandals are fine. Put those toes away !! No one wants to see that. Also, flip flops are horrible for your feet so there's no excuse !!</p>

			<h3>Not on the same page with lifelong goals (kids, etc.)</h3>
			<p>This one is less of a red flag and more of a compatability issue. These are fundamental differences that might not work out in the long run. It is important to think about the possible consequences and potential resentment from one side compromising on these essential questions and values (haivng kids, religion, lifestyle, etc.)</p>

			<h3>Won't introduce you to their friends</h3>
			<p>This one is always weird to me. Not wanting to introduce you to their friends means they think something is wrong with their friends or that something is wrong with you. Neither is ideal.</p>

			<h3>Peaked in high school</h3>
			<p>No one wants to hear about their "glory days," yet they still show you their sport reel on your first date. Wack.</p>

			<h3>3:1 shampoo</h3>
			<p>They should care more. That's all.</p>

			<h3>Wears camo casually in an urban setting</h3>
			<p>Who are they hiding from ????</p>

			<h3>Idolizes Elon Musk</h3>
			<p>This one has gotten so much worse than when we first added it to the list lol. He's so cringe I don't get it at all. Hope they have fun licking the boot of a billionaire self-proclaimed meme lord. Like I hate that I even wrote that sentence.</p>

			<h3>Thinks the red flag list is stupid</h3>
			<p>Sounds like they're getting defensive ? The list isn't an issue unless they're problematic or they can't accept that some random person told them they shouldn't wear flip flops anymore and they're taking it wayyyy too personally.</p>

			<h3>Liberal is their only good quality</h3>
			<p>If you're friends are calling out your partner and your response is "but they're liberal," leave. Being liberal is not enough !</p>

			<h3>Drinks whole milk by itself casually or often</h3>
			<p>I don't really have any justification for this I just think its icky.</p>

			<h3>Overly agressive when watching sports</h3>
			<p>This is giving the girls who absolutely lost it in high school when Zane left One Direction. They're an adult and should be beyond the emotional response of a teenager with a parasocial relationship with a band.</p>

			<h3>No comforter</h3>
			<p>Grow up.</p>

			<h3>Calls women "females"</h3>
			<p>It's giving incel :/</p>

			<h3>Only listens to EDM</h3>
			<p>... why</p>

			<h3>No drip</h3>
			<p>Caring about how they present themselves to the world is cool! Wearing a free tshirt you got during freshman orientation everyday is not.</p>

			<h3>Obsessed with video games</h3>
			<p>Please for the love of god do something else with life.</p>

			<h3>From Florida</h3>
			<p>No explanation needed.</p>

			<h3>Hates cats</h3>
			<p>This is for the people who make hating cats a personality trait. If they bring up that they hate cats everytime someone talks about cats, why are they so enthusiastic about killing someone else's joy? Like that's so obnoxious. Cats are different than dogs in that they aren't going to let you pet them if they don't want you to. If they can't respect the boundaries of a cat, how do you expect them to respect your boundaries? Cats are also often associated with feminity, so it's a little suspicious when a man agressively hates cats.</p>

			<h3>Wants a gold star for respecting women</h3>
			<p>Once again, bare minimum. Y'all remember when Matt Damon was like "no one's talking about the guys that aren't assaulting women" during the #metoo movement. Yea ... that.</p>

			<h3>Only Child</h3>
			<p>Idk only children usually just have this unexplainable ~vibe~. Like you can tell they didn't have to share toys growing up ya know?</p>
