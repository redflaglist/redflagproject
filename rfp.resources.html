	<h3>The Red Flag List - Why are these red flags?</h3>
	<div class="red flag list">
		<p>Read about how the<a href="theredflaglist.html"> Red Flags</a> got on the list and see resources/information for specific red flags.

		<h3>Abuse Hotlines, Resources, and Information</h3>
		<div class="abuse resources">
			<p>Many of the red flags on this list are precursors or symptoms of abuse. If you or someone you know are in need of help, here are some good resources:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>People experiencing relationship violence often face mental distress. If you are concerned about the safety of yourself or those around you, dial 988 for support.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.thehotline.org/">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a></li>
				<li>It takes, on average, 7 times for a survivor of abuse to successfully leave their partner. Leaving an abusive partner usually requires an incredible amount of courage, the financial means to leave, a well thought out safety plan, and a solid support system. Having the means to leave is not always possible or accessible to survivors. It is important to remember to never judge or admonish a survivor for not leaving their abuser. Read more about safety plans <a href="https://padv.org/safety-planning/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-a-safety-plan/">here</a>.</li>
				<li>If you know someone in an abusive situation, it is important to know how to act, so you don't unintentionally put your friend in more danger. Read more about supporting survivors <a href="https://www.joinonelove.org/learn/help_a_friend/">here</a>. Some main takeaways from this article:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Telling your friend to break up with their partner will (almost) never work (trust me I've tried). Your friend needs to come to this decision on their own.</li>
						<li>Don't put any blame on your friend - it is not their fault! Don't tell them that they should have higher standards, etc.</li>
						<li>Do not put pressure on them or give them ultimatums. Trying to force their hand will prevent them from being honest with you about their relationship in the future. This might also isolate them further from their support system.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.joinonelove.org/">One Love</a> has a lot of great resources and information relating to ending relationship abuse. </li>
				<li>Domestic Violence does not discriminate. While women are the largest demographic of abuse survivors, any gender can and does experience relationship violence. Men are often not taken seriously when they open up about abuse they've faced, but we can start to change that!</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Read more about survivors who are men <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/resources/men-can-be-victims-of-abuse-too/">here</a>.</li>
						<li>Read more about how to support men who have experienced domestic abuse <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/working-male-survivors-sexual-violence">here</a>.</li>
						<li><a href="https://1in6.org/">1in6</a> is a website that provides resources and information for men who have been sexually abused or assaulted.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Often times survivors of abuse invalidate themselves because they beleive others have been through worse. Abuse can't be quantified or compared. No one's experience is less or more valid than your own. These resources are for everyone - even if you're not even sure if you'd label your experience as abuse, you can still use these resources! These resources also often provide support for friends of survivors.</li>

<h3>Georgia Tech Specific Resources</h3>
	<div class="gt">
	<p>This project originally began as a project for the Georgia Tech Women's Resource Center. If you go to Georgia Tech and are in need of help or support, here are some resources that could be helpful:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are a student who has experienced sexual assault and want to persue action within your school, Title IX is the place to go. Title IX is often complicated, long, and can be retraumatizing, so here are some resources that will help simplify the process for you: <a href="https://careers.gatech.edu/resources/employee-relations/title-IX">Title IX at Georgia Tech</a> and <a href="https://knowyourix.org/college-resources/title-ix/">Know Your IX</a></li>
			<li>VOICE is a great resource for pretty much anything relating to sexual violence. The VOICE advocates there can offer confidential victim-survivor support, help you through the Title IX process, explain options, provide accomodations (like housing & class changes), and give referrals for longterm care. VOICE peer educators also offer educational programs to explain bystander intervention and other concepts to organizations at Georgia Tech. Learn more about VOICE <a href="https://wellnesscenter.gatech.edu/voice">here</a>.</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://womenscenter.gatech.edu/">Women's Resource Center</a> and the <a href="https://lgbtqia.gatech.edu/">LGBTQIA Resource Center</a> are great resources for people at Tech who are looking to find community within these aspects of their identity. These centers also host events and programs to educate and empower those at Georgia Tech.
