	<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">The Red Flag Project started as a bit (as most good things do). After reminiscing with some friends about all 
			of the dog shit experiences we've had with exes, we decided to compile a list of all the things that should've been the 
			sign we needed to leave or make some serious changes in the relationship; the red flags. Thus the Red Flag Project was born.
			After years of adding and debating the contents of the red flag list, one of the original creators went to grad school to 
			get her Master's in Public Health (that's me!). There, I realized the potential for this list to become a successful 
			intervention that targets a population that is particularly prone to dating violence. I think it's kinda cool that what
			started as a joke turned into a genuine tool that we used to assess situationships and current partners, and validate 
			all of the complicated feelings we had about our exes.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">I started this project by looking at previous research relating to healthy relationships, warning signs, 
			and general studies about how relationships can affect people's well-being and quality of life. From there I interviewed
			therapists, sexual violence experts, and surveyed young adults to get a more in-depth and personal perspective on the 
			problems young adults face in relationships. With a limited understanding of html/css/javascript, I then took all the 
			information and feedback from the interviews, surveys, and research I had done and made this website (for free! - if 
			you want to pay me for this project you can venmo me @avogel9 lol ... jk .... unless ...).</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Thank you to everyone who contributed to this project. Whether it was feedback on formatting, design, 
			content, or sharing your story with me, I appreciate every person who provided inspiration and knowledge to this project. 
			Special thanks to Ria, Claire, Lindsey and Sofi, who were integral to the conception of the Red Flag List. </p>
